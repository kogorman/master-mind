This project is a Python program that implements a solver for the Guess
program of the "SFC Puzzles Collection" on Ubuntu Linux.  This is essentially
the same game as the commercial "Mastermind" game of the 1970s.

This solution was inspired/guided by the paper "Computer as Master Mind"
by Donald E Knuth (J. Recreational Mathematics, Vol. 9(1), 1976-77.)

The GitHub project is master-mind, but I name the program itself "guesser"
because I use it with the "guess" program.
                  
The program is pure Python 3, using only the Python builtin modules
argparser, sys and random.

You can see the command-line options by running the program as 
    guesser.py -h
You can have it give numeric guesses, as in the Knuth paper, or initials
or full color names.  You can even make up names.

Example run:

$ ./guesser.py
Master Mind
Invoke "./guesser.py -h" for options and other help

Guess 1122 result: 01
Guess 2344 result: 10
Guess 3315 result: 01
Guess 2566 result: 02
Guess 6641 result: 40
 SUCCESS: all black

Guess 1122 result: end


Goodbye and thanks for playing!
$

Example with random choice among possible guesses, and using initials
of color from "guess" (initials are rygbtp corresponding to 123456):

  ./guesser.py -rg
  Master Mind

  Guess byby result: 00
  Guess rpgr result: 03
  Guess tgrp result: 22
  Guess gtrp result: 13
  Guess pgrt result: 40
   SUCCESS: all black

  Guess 1122 result: exit


  Goodbye and thanks for playing!

Example with randomized guesses, counts, extension flag and short color names,

  $ ./guesser.py -rcx -wRed,Yel,Grn,Blu,Tan,Pur
  Master Mind

  Guess   1296(Pur Yel Yel Pur) result: 01
  Guess    256(Yel Red Red Grn) result: 12
  Guess     21(Grn Red Tan Yel) result: 22
  Guess      2(Tan Red Grn Yel) result: 13
  Guess      1(Grn Tan Red Yel) result: 40
  SUCCESS: all black

  Guess   1296(Blu Pur Blu Pur) result: quit


  Goodbye and thanks for playing!
