                                   On Figure 1

The Knuth paper included in the Knuth paper "Computer as Master Mind" has been
transformed here into a spreadsheet.  I therefore submit the following
"translation" of part of the discussion in the original paper.

The CSV format is software-agnostic and does not include any formatting
information.  You may want to adjust a few things depeinding on the software
you are using.  You may find it convenient to resize column B to be
similar to the other columns, some software makes it very wide to accomodate
the text in cell B1.  You may also want to align everything to the right,
and add one leading zero to the contents of each of the cells A4-A18 and
A23-A27 to make each of these two digits, as that is the input required
for the guesser program.

Translation follows:

  Let's consider a more typcial play of the game using the strategy of spread-
sheet Figure1.csv.  If the answer to the first test pattern 1122 is "10" (one
black hit) the original 1296 possibilities have been reduced to 256, and we go
to the situation captioned "F" (see cells A12 and B12); this is the situation
in column J rows 21 through 40.  The second test pattern (cf. cell J22) is
1344, and let's say the answer is "01" (one white hit).  There are 44
possibilities remaining, and our third guess is 3526.  If the result this time
is "12" (one black hit, two white hits), the spreadsheet says that seven
possibilities survive, and the test pattern 1462 will distinguish them. ...
